Passhole
--------

Passhole is a simple CLI and dmenu interface for KeePass 1.x (v3) and 2.x (v4) files.

Passhole allows you to edit and generate passwords much in the same way as the popular `pass`_ utility.

Passhole can also generate `correct horse battery staple`_ style passwords, which have plenty of entropy and are easier to type out manually than random alphanumeric passwords.
